# Name of the workflow, which will be displayed in the "Actions" tab of your GitHub repository.
name: Deploy to Production Server

# Controls when the workflow will run.
# This workflow triggers on a push event but only for the "main" branch.
on:
  push:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel.
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "deploy"

    # The type of runner that the job will run on. We use the latest Ubuntu version.
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job.

      # Step 1: Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it.

        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up Node.js. This is good practice for CI, allowing you to run tests or build steps.
      # You can specify the Node.js version you use in your project.

      # (Optional but Recommended) Step 3: Install dependencies and run tests.
      # This is the "CI" part. If tests fail, the deployment will stop, preventing bugs from reaching production.
